# ML-Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnosis
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify whether the given patient is having Malignant or Benign tumor based on the attributes in the given dataset the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It includes data preprocessing (outlier removal, normalization), label encoding, train-test split, and model training. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV, and model performance is evaluated with accuracy, cross-validation, and a classification report. The optimal k value is determined and visualized for improved accuracy.
